The [IRremote library](ELEGOO_IRremote.zip) was extracted from the elegoo kit resources.

The library was installed using the following command: `pio.exe lib install \.ELEGOO_IRremote.zip`

There are [more modern versions](https://www.makerguides.com/ir-receiver-remote-arduino-tutorial/) of the library to be used but they don't seem to work quite right.
